# Odin delivery roadmap

Checkboxes mean verified repository evidence, not intent. Milestones are completed sequentially;
later design work may occur early, but later product capability is not declared complete early.

## M0 — Repository foundation

- [x] Research source read and architecture observations extracted.
- [x] Empty-repository baseline and branch state established.
- [x] Product contract, architecture, security, contributor rules, and handover created.
- [x] ADR process and initial architecture decisions recorded.
- [x] Locked Node/TypeScript toolchain and secret-safe environment example created.
- [x] Pull-request CI and deterministic foundation validation established.
- [x] CI result observed on the pull request.

Exit gate: clean install plus `npm run verify` passes locally and in CI; documentation agrees with
the repository; no product capability is overstated.

## M1 — Provider core

- [x] Normalized request, response, streaming, usage, tool-call, and error contracts.
- [x] Capability registry with config overrides and provenance.
- [x] OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, NVIDIA, and generic compatible adapters.
- [x] Abort, timeout, retry hints, rate limit, malformed output, and context overflow handling.
- [x] Injected-transport contract tests with no live cost.

## M2 — Mission runtime

- [x] Mission aggregate, typed state machine, task DAG, focus classification, and definitions of done.
- [x] Deterministic scheduler, budgets, retries, pause/resume/cancel, and anti-loop circuit breaker.
- [x] Append-only events, projections, checkpoints, optimistic versions, and recovery tests.

## M3 — Tool runtime

- [x] Tool registry and progressive discovery foundation; full skill package lifecycle remains M10.
- [x] Schema validation, risk classes, capability policy, idempotency, timeout, retry, and audit trail.
- [x] Scoped repository search/read/patch and quality-command tools.

## M4 — Coding vertical slice

- [x] Repository understanding and quality-gate discovery through scoped M3 tools.
- [x] Strict plan and task graph generated through the normalized M1 provider boundary.
- [x] Minimal scoped edit in an injected disposable fixture workspace.
- [x] Deliberate quality failure diagnosed, repaired, rerun, and mapped to evidence.
- [x] Interruption/resume demonstrated end to end over replayed M2 event-store state.

M4 proves orchestration across the M1/M2/M3 contracts with scripted provider responses and injected
in-memory fixtures. It does not claim a production OS sandbox, live-provider compatibility, or durable
SQLite/PostgreSQL recovery.

## M5–M12

- [ ] M5 verification engine and adversarial review.
- [ ] M6 memory, context compiler, token budgets, and cache.
- [ ] M7 isolated specialists, ownership, and reconciliation.
- [ ] M8 persistent workers, event fan-out, reconnect, and long-running recovery.
- [ ] M9 responsive web client and native-client protocol strategy.
- [ ] M10 progressively loaded, permissioned, independently tested skills.
- [ ] M11 empirical model routing, caching, concurrency, and cost optimization.
- [ ] M12 security/load/recovery hardening, backups, observability, and eval release gates.

## MVP definition of done

MVP requires a user-supplied provider key, workspace, complex coding request, automatic plan and task
graph, targeted repository retrieval, scoped edits, tests, diagnosis and repair, durable mission
resume, token/cost display, and an evidence-backed final report. A mock-only demonstration does not
satisfy MVP.
